# Twitch JSON API

User Stories: 

- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv. </li>
- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel. 
- if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming. 


### Pre-requisites
UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. 
    
Use https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

Technology Used: 
- HTML
- SCSS
- Jquery 
- Twitch API call
- Gulp
- NodeJs


#### Potential improvements
- Make pure JavaScript
- Make in a frameworks
- NodeJs
