# Automated Testing and Debugging

## Using JavaScript Console

- Chrome or firefox can be used as debugging tools 
- log to console hello world

```sh
console.log('Hello world!');
```





## Usiny TypeOf

* You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable.

* Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

* Try using typeof on each of the following to see which types they have.


```sh
console.log(typeof "");

console.log(typeof 0);

console.log(typeof []);

console.log(typeof {});
```
